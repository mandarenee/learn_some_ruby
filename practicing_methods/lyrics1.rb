puts "\tFeeling my way through the darkness \n\
	Guided by a beating heart \n\
	I can't tell where the journey will end \n\
	But I know where to start \n\
	They tell me I'm too young to understand \n\
	They say I'm caught up in a dream \n\
	Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes \n\
	Well that's fine by me \n\n\

	So wake me up when it's all over \n\
	When I'm wiser and I'm older \n\
	All this time I was finding myself \n\
	And I didn't know﻿ I was lost \n\n\

	So wake me up when it's all over \n\
	When I'm wiser and I'm older \n\
	All this time I was finding myself \n\
	And I didn't know﻿ I was lost \n\n\

	I tried carrying the weight of the world \n\
	But I only have two hands \n\
	I hope I get the chance to travel the world \n\
	But I don't have any plans \n\
	I wish that I could stay forever this young \n\
	Not afraid to close my eyes \n\
	Life's a game﻿ made for everyone \n\
	And love is the prize \n\n\

	So wake me up when it's all over \n\
	When I'm wiser and I'm older \n\
	All this time I was finding myself \n\
	And I didn't know﻿ I was lost \n\n\

	So wake me up when it's all over \n\
	When I'm wiser and I'm older \n\
	All this time I was finding myself \n\
	And I didn't know﻿ I was lost \n\n\

	I didn't know I was lost \n\
	I didn't know I was lost \n\
	I didn't know I was lost \n\
	I didn't know I was lost \n\n\

	So wake me up when it's all over \n\
	When I'm wiser and I'm older \n\
	All this time I was finding myself \n\
	And I didn't know﻿ I was lost"
