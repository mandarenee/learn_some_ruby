Have you ever felt so %{adjective_1} that you just want to %{verb}?
Well, I have a solution! You just have to spend
some time with a %{adjective_2} %{animal}.
Especially if the %{animal} is %{ing_verb}.
If that doesn't work, try getting a %{noun},
or several %{plural_noun}.
That should definitely do the trick.
